# Metrics Toolkit
The **metrics toolkit** (**formerly the metrics accelerator/framework**) is a Mule application intended to collect, aggregate and load platform metrics into different visualization systems; providing out of the box integrations and visualization options, including useful dashboards and charts. In addition to the platform metrics, the toolkit also extends the capabilities to integrate with external applications like Jira, Confluence, Jenkins, Bitbucket and Splunk to gather SDLC metrics. This is an [UNLICENSED software, please review the considerations](UNLICENSE.md). If you need assistance on extending this application, contact your MuleSoft Customer Success representative or MuleSoft Professional Services

## Features
- Compact Mule application (1 single application)
- Provides more than 100 metrics from 3 complementary domains:
	- **Platform Operational Metrics**: collected and calculated automatically based on multiple products from Anypoint Platform: Exchange, Design Center, Runtime Manager, Access Management; covering metrics from applications deployed on-prem (Standalone), RTF and CloudHub.
	- **Platform Benefits**: require manual input to calculate final metrics, crossing information from the "Platform Operational" domain
	- **External SDLC Metrics**: collected and calculated automatically based on multiple external applications: Jira, Confluence, Jenkins, Bitbucket and Splunk;

![Domains](/img/domains.png)

### Modes
- Poller (Push mode)
	- Collects, transforms and loads metrics in a defined visualization system
	- Configurable - frequency (cron expression and timezone ) and status (enabled/disabled).

- API to manage the asset:
	- API endpoint to obtain metrics on-demand (Pull mode)
	- API endpoint for triggering a specific loader to push data to a visualization system
	- API endpoint for loading platform benefits - manual input required

### Loader options
- **CSV**
- **JSON**
- **Plain Log**: in case you forward logs to external systems (e.g using Splunk forwarder)
- **Splunk**: Including an out of the box dashboard with more than 100 charts
- **ELK**: Including out of the box, basic, Kibana dashboards
- **Anypoint Monitoring**: Requires Titanium subscription, dashboard is not provided
- **Embedded dashboard**: Including an out of the box basic embedded dashboard accessed by running the application offering an UI with a number of metrics obtained
- **Tableau**: including an out of the box dashboard with current consolidated platform metrics
- **MongoDB**
- **SFDC**: The Salesforce Loader will load data into **Tableau CRM**, formerly known as **Einstein Analytics** via the Salesforce Analytics connector.  Dashboards are not provided, and it is assumed users are familiar with Tableau CRM, data recipes, and Analytics Studio. 

**NOTES:** 
- some adjustments in Metrics Toolkit implementation may be required if the loader does not work as expected for your specific scenario.
- By default, CSV loader output uses comma as the separator char. In order to change the CSV output format, modify the output options in `loader-csv-build-structure.dwl` and/or `loader-csv-build-benefits-structure.dwl` located under `src/main/resources/dw/loader` directory. For more information about CSV output formatting options, check [MuleSoft's official documentation](https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/latest/dataweave-formats-csv).

**NOTE:** Please note that each external system collector should be self-contained, it means that all associated configuration must be part of the Mule configuration file itself and must not be externalized inside the `global.xml`

### Postman Collection 
A Postman collection which contains sample API requests is included under /postman/postman_collection.json. To import this, open Postman and click File > Import, and select the .json file. The collection contains documentation describing prerequisites and setup. Clicking the collection folder opens the documentation window. A number of Environment variables are needed. A template environment is also included under /postman/environment_template.json. To import into Postman, click Environemts > Import and select the .json file. Populate the variables with accurate values. 

### Splunk steps

1. Create 2 indexes: metrics and platform_benefits (of type Events)
2. In the Splunk instance configure an HTTP Event Collector (HEC) associated to these 2 indexes, format _json
3. The token obtained will be used as part of the properties of the Mule application
4. Create a new application  
5. Load the dashboards, simply copy the xmls provided under `/dashboards/splunk` to `{SPLUNK_HOME}/etc/apps/{APP_NAME}/local/data/ui/views`
6. Restart the Splunk instance
7. If you can't copy the dashboard xmls, you can use the UI to create them and using the "Source" option, you can copy & paste the content of the xmls provided

Follow official Splunk documentation: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/

#### Properties specific for Splunk
Name | Description | Default Value
------------ | ------------ | ------------
splunk.host | HTTP Event Collector (HEC) host |
splunk.port | HEC port | 8088
splunk.protocol | HEC endpoint protocol: HTTPS or HTTP | HTTP
splunk.token | HEC token  |
splunk.source | HEC source | metrics-source
splunk.source.type | Source Type | _json (*)
splunk.index.metrics | Index for storing Platform operational metrics | metrics
splunk.index.benefits | Index for storing Platform benefits | platform_benefits


> (*): Please note that by default, "Source Types" are created with a limit of 3000 characters. The Metrics Toolkit JSON event will likely exceed this limit. In order to solve that, you must increase this limit adding a new property "TRUNCATE" in the Advanced configuration of the specific Source Type. For example: TRUNCATE = 40000. Depending of the size of your organization, in terms of Business Groups, environments and number of applications and APIs in each environment, this value can be higher.

### ELK steps

**NOTE:** Dashboards were created and tested with Kibana 7.6.2, adjustments may be necessary for other versions

1. The toolkit will load data into the `metrics` and `platformbenefits` indexes. Once data is loaded create an index pattern on Kibana for these indexes
2. Set the loader strategy to `elk` on the `app-{env}.yaml` file, along with the `elk.user` and `elk.password` parameters in the secure `app-{env}.yaml` file
3. To load the dashboards, replace the `<YOUR-INDEX-PATTERN-ID>` occurrences on all of the dashboards provided under `/dashboards/elk` with your index pattern ID. The index pattern ID can be obtained on Kibana under `Management>>Index Patterns`
4. Log into your Kibana instance, and on the `Management>>Saved Objects` menu, click on import for each dashboard. This will import all dashboards and visualizations


Follow official ELK documentation: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index.html

#### Properties specific for ELK
Name | Description | Default Value
------------ | ------------ | ------------
elk.host | Elasticsearch host |
elk.port | Elasticsearch port | 9200
elk.protocol | Elasticsearch protocol: HTTP | HTTP
elk.user | Elasticsearch username  |
elk.password | Elasticsearch password |
elk.index.metrics | Index for storing Platform operational metrics | metrics
elk.index.benefits | Index for storing Platform benefits | platformbenefits

### Tableau steps
 
Tableau Dashboards use a JSON File Data Source, which is configured to load data from all JSON files present in a given directory, each JSON file representing a Platform Metrics snapshot.

Metrics Toolkit provides the following approaches to generated those files:
- Using Tableau Strategy (poller or API): this option can only be used if Tableau Desktop can can access the filesystem where Metrics Toolkit is running (**cannot be used for CloudHub or Runtime Fabric, since Tableau Desktop won't be able to access Mule Runtime local filesystem**).
- Using the Get Platform Metrics API operation (check _GET Platform Metrics_ request provided in the Postman collection): suitable if Metrics Toolkit is running on CloudHub or Runtime Fabric, or if you don't have access to Mule Runtime local filesystem.

To learn more about Tableau, follow the official documentation: https://www.tableau.com/support/help

**NOTES:**
- Tableau Dashboard Data Source will only use JSON files which has the following naming pattern: **platform_metrics_agg_\*.json**
- Tableau Dashboard Data Source will only be able to use JSON files containing aggregated data. Thus, Tableau won't be able to render dashboards if JSON files contain raw data (check [Properties Configuration Section](properties_configurations) for futher details.

#### Generating JSON Files Using Poller or API Loader Tableau Strategy

When using the Tableau Strategy, Metrics Toolkit will create the JSON files in the directory defined by  `tableau.outputDir` property (poller) or by `loaderDetails.outputDir` provided in the request (API).

Check _POST Platform Metrics - Load - Tableau Strategy_ Postman collection request if using the API Loader.

***IMPORTANT:*** Make sure `aggregation.raw` property (poller) or `loaderDetails.rawData` (API) is set to ***false***

#### Generating JSON Files Using Get Platform Metrics API operation

1. Use JSON loader strategy via API (check  POST Platform Metrics - Load - JSON Strategy in the provided Postman collection)
2. Save the response content as a JSON file in the directory of your choice. All files must be in the same directory and must respect the naming convention (**platform_metrics_agg_yyyyMMddHHmmssSSS.json**)

***IMPORTANT:*** Make sure the query parameter `raw` is set to ***false***

#### Visualizing Dashboards in Tableau Desktop

1. Before opening a workbook in Tableau Desktop, make sure that you have at least one JSON file available.
2. Make a copy of the desired workbook provided under `/dashboards/tableau`.
3. After copying the workbook, open it in Tableau Desktop. 
4. When prompted, edit workbook connection. Select one of the available JSON files and click Ok.

#### Properties specific for Tableau
Name | Description | Default Value
------------ | ------------ | ------------
tableau.outputDir | Directory where JSON files will be written to. |

#### File name pattern by workbook
Workbook | File Name Pattern 
------------ | ------------ 
current_consolidated | platform_metrics_agg_*.json |

### Embedded Dashboard steps
1. Enable the dashboard by changing the embedded.dashboard.enabled property to "true"
2. Deploy & Run the application
3. Use a web browser to access the applications base URL (e.g. if deployed locally, use http://localhost:8081)
4. Use the "Login" page to enter your Anypoint platform username, password and organization ID
5. Wait for the dashboard to run the metrics request and once done, navigate through the different metrics taken using the UI

### SFDC Steps
Using the `sfdc` loader option, and initialising Salesforce Analytics Studio with an empty project, will allow you to quickly inject data into Tableau CRM Dashboards to visualise your Anypoint Platform Metrics in different ways.  Tableau CRM can also be used as an historic data repository to allow the metrics data to be displayed against time for trend analysis (e.g. vCore growth, API count or transaction growth over time).

1. Create a new application in Data Manager
2. If using the poller functionality, configure the SFDC loader properties in the properties files. If using the API, format the request body with the required parameters
3. Deploy and Run the metrics toolkit application, allowing the poller to execute, or performing an API request
4. Validate the dataset is created in Data Manager
5. Create a new data recipe, setting your new dataset as the source. Transform "value" from a dimension to a measure. 
6. (Optional) - Filter out the non-numeric value fields (API Manager Policies Used and CloudHub Runtime Versions Used) and store this in a new 'enum' dataset
7. (Optional) - Create a 'historic' dataset. Add a step to your data recipe to append to this historic dataset
More detailed steps can be found in the [SFDC specific README](README_sfdc.md). 

**Note:** This is only a high level introduction and it is highly recommended that you become familiar with Tableau CRM through official documentation. 

#### Properties specific for SFDC
Name | Description | Default Value
------------ | ------------ | ------------
sfdc.appName | Application name in Tableau CRM |
sfdc.dataSetName | Dataset name to be created/overwritten in Tableau CRM | 
sfdc.notificationEmail | Email adress for notifications to be sent to | 
sfdc.sendNotification | Occurances which should generate notifications. ENUM values are: ALWAYS,FAILURES,NEVER,WARNINGS | NEVER
sfdc.username | Salesforce username to use for authentication | 
sfdc.password | Salesforce password | 
sfdc.securityToken | Salesforce developer security token | 
sfdc.authUrl | Specific Salesforce auth URL to be used if required | 

### MONGODB steps

**NOTE:** Data was pushed and tested with Mongodb 4.4.1. Adjustments may be necessary for other versions.

1. In MongoDB you will need to create a Database called `matrixdb` and a Collection called `metrics`.
2. Set the loader strategy to `mongodb` on the `app-{env}.yaml` file, along with the `mongodb.username` and `mongodb.password` parameters in the secure `app-{env}.yaml` file
3. Uncomment 2 sections from the pom.xml (dependencies and shared library)
4. Rename the file src/main/mule/loaders/loader-mongodb.disabled to src/main/mule/loaders/loader-mongodb.xml

#### Properties specific for MONGODB
Name | Description | Default Value
------------ | ------------ | ------------
mongodb.host | MongoDB host |
mongodb.port | MongoDB port |
mongodb.database | Database name |
mongodb.colleciton | Collection Name |
mongodb.username | MongoDB user |

- This application can be deployed in any Mule Runtime (OnPrem, CloudHub, RTF)
- The metrics collection will depend on the features available in each account; e.g if the account has the API Manager add-on, the toolkit will collect and aggregate the metrics related to API Manager, otherwise the values will appear as zeroes; if using PCE, there won't be information about API Analytics
- In order to enable or disable specific collectors, you have to change the property "collectors" if using the poller or add a query parameter "collectors" if using the API, including a CSV string as explained in the properties section

## Limitations

- **Access Management** metrics:
	- Not supported on **GovCloud**
- **Exchange** reuse metrics:
	- Not supported for Private Cloud Edition (**PCE**)
- **API Manager** metrics:
	- API Manager metrics available only for accounts with the **API Manager** and Analytics **add-on**
- Runtime Manager (**CloudHub**) application metrics: 
	- CloudHub is not supported on Private Cloud Edition (**PCE**)
- Runtime Manager (**CloudHub**) **networking** metrics - VPCs, VPNs, DLBs and static IPs usage: 
	- Not supported when authenticating with **Connected Apps**
	- Not supported on **GovCloud**
- Runtime Manager (**RuntimeFabric**) metrics: 
    - Runtime Fabric is not supported on **GovCloud**
	- Runtime Fabric is not supported on Private Cloud Edition (**PCE**)
- Runtime Manager (**Standalone**) metrics: 
    - Runtime Manager (Standalone Runtimes) not supported on **GovCloud**
- **API Platform Client Applications** metrics: 
	- Not supported when authenticating with **Connected Apps**
	- Not supported on **GovCloud**
- **Analytics** metrics: 
	- Not supported on **GovCloud**
	- Not supported on Private Cloud Edition (**PCE**)
	- Not supported when authenticating with **Connected Apps**
- **Anypoint MQ** metrics: 
	- Not supported on Private Cloud Edition (**PCE**)
	- Not supported when authenticating with **Connected Apps**
	- Not supported on **GovCloud**
- **OSv2** metrics: 
  - Not supported on Private Cloud Edition (**PCE**)
  - Not supported when authenticating with **Connected Apps**

## Some Theory around the Toolkit
The toolkit is intended to cover the main areas to define and implement metrics using Mule.

### Business Needs

There are several business needs around the definition of metrics. The principal goal is to provide **visibility** on 4 main areas: People/Teams, Projects, Processes and Technology. By having visibility on these areas, the involved stakeholders can make decisions, anticipate technical and non-technical needs and optimize time and resources

### Data Sources

Any system containing raw data

### Measurements

1. **Basic measurements**:

Examples:
- Number of projects
- Number of incidents

2. **Complex/Composed measurements**

Examples:
- Average daily-TPS per application/project
- vCores usage per application/project - monthly

3. **Indexes/KPIs**

Examples:
- Growth
- Tendencies
- Efficiency / Performance

### Problem Space

How to link business needs, measurements and data sources?

### Approach - Conceptual

1. **Event**: Canonical object representing a metric, based on dimensions and facts

2. **Collectors**: Processes to Collect raw data from different data sources

3. **Aggregators/Transformers**: Transform (calculate, compose, enrich, build metric/event normalized/denormalized objects

4. **Loaders**: Processes to send/load events into external storages/systems

5. **Visualization**: Third party systems for showing charts and dashboards based on metrics-events (e.g Microstrategy, Tableau, Splunk dashboards, ELK, custom dashboards, BI software, etc)

## Common Errors 

### Permission errors
- All `403` errors, specifically, for the endpoint related to RTF deployments /hybrid/api/v2/ are permissions issues, be sure the user/connected-app has the right permissions (Runtime Manager and Runtime Fabric specifically): [Requirements](#requirements)
